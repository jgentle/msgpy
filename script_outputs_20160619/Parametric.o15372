Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data...

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data...

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)

Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...

Here we go! Calculating some tasty new scalar data!
Heating up the pot... 
Whisking in wells data... 
Tasting the tablelinks data... 
Simmering the scalars data... 
Seasoning the data...
(pssst! A watched pot never boils so grab a coffee, these things take time!)
